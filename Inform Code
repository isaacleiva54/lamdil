The attacking it with action has a number called the damage inflicted.
Setting action variables for attacking something with something: 
	if the second noun is a weapon: 
		let the maximum attack be the maximum damage of the second noun; 
		now the damage inflicted is a random number between 1 and the maximum attack.
Check an actor attacking something with something (this is the can't attack with something that isn't a weapon rule): 
	if the second noun is not a weapon: 
		if the actor is the player, say "[The second noun] does not qualify as a weapon."; 
		stop the action.
Check an actor attacking something with something (this is the can't attack a non-person rule): 
	if the noun is not a person: 
		if the actor is the player, say "[The noun] has no life to lose."; 
		stop the action.
Carry out an actor attacking something with something (this is the standard attacking it with a weapon rule): 
	decrease the current hit points of the noun by the damage inflicted; 
	say "You attack [the noun], causing [damage inflicted] points of damage!"; 
	if the current hit points of the noun is less than 0:
		say "[line break][The noun] falls to his knees and breathes his last breath as he collapses onto the floor. The room trembles under his weight as he fizzles into nothing."; 
		now the noun is nowhere; 
		end the story finally;
		stop the action;
	 let the enemy damage be a random number between 3 and 5; 
	say "[line break][The noun] attacks you, causing [enemy damage] points of damage!"; 
	decrease the current hit points of the player by the enemy damage; 
	if the current hit points of the player is less than 0: 
		say "[line break]YOU DIED!"; 
		end the story.
