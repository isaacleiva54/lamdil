Cell 1
You wake up in a cold, damp room that appears to look like a cell. Your head is throbbing as you 
wonder how you got here. With the light from a nearby torch in the room, you see a note.

## History of the Game

This game was created by Liam Abalos, Minh Dinh, and Isaac Leiva as a secondary project for
an AP Computer Science course. To make the game, Inform 7 was used, an interactive fiction
design system based off of natural language instead of "complicated computer code". The game
has been through many stages of story and gameplay to finally end up with the version you 
see before you.
