"[if the player is in the F1 for the first time]Darkness envelops your surroundings as your mind begins to fill in the unknown with your greatest fears."
"[if the player is in the F1 for the first time]With each passing room almost identical to the last, you start to question if you will ever make it out again." 
"[if the player is in the F1 for the first time]How many more rooms must you pass, how many more men must your slay to find the answer to what you're searching for?"
"[if the player is in the F1 for the first time]The sanctuary is silent yet you can still feel the presence of an unworldy energy far ahead." 
"[if the player is in the F1 for the first time]Your feet grow weary as your begrudgingly travel further, and further into the abyss."
"[if the player is in the F1 for the first time]You cry out hoping someone, anyone can hear you but in the back of your mind you know nobody can save you but yourself."
"[if the player is in the F1 for the first time]Your voice echoes growing louder, then silent, and loud again as if the laws of physics do not apply in this realm."
"[if the player is in the F1 for the first time]In the far distance you notice a small bright light which shines for only a second and quickly fades into the darkness." 
"[if the player is in the F1 for the first time]Loneliness and boredom entangle your thoughts as you progress through what seems like an endless amount of rooms." 
"[if the player is in the F1 for the first time]The air is cold, yet within you a warmth can be felt that ignites you. You must press on." 
"[if the player is in the F1 for the first time]The darkness draws you in pulling you closer, and closer to the heart of the sanctuary. You are no longer afraid."
